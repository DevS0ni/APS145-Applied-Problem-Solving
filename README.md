Course Description
----------------------------------------
After successful completion of this course, it helped me to...
```
  * introduce the concepts of critical and computational thinking with an emphasis on problem solving and problem analysis.
  * provide the basis for deriving application and system solutions.
  * Identify the steps of a logical construct using pseudo-code to solve a simple computational problem
  * Analyze a practical problem into modular components using accepted decomposition principles to develop a supportable solution to a problem
  * Identify the detail stages in the solution of a problem using flowcharting techniques to communicate the flow of the solution.
  * Explain the major elements of a solution using effective communication techniques to inform peers and non-technical business persons
  * Apply numeracy skills to solve fundamental practical problems
  * Communicate clearly, concisely and correctly in the written, spoken and visual form that fulfils the purpose and meets the needs of the audience.
  * Respond to written, spoken, or visual messages in a manner that ensures effective communication.
  * Execute mathematical operations accurately.
  * Apply a systematic approach to solve problems.
  * Use a variety of thinking skills to anticipate and solve problems.
  * Locate, select, organize, and document information using appropriate technology and information systems.
  * Analyze, evaluate, and apply relevant information from a variety of sources.
  * Show respect for diverse opinions, values, belief systems, and contributions of others.
  * Interact with others in groups or teams in ways that contribute to effective working relationships and the achievement of goals.
  * Manage the use of time and other resources to complete projects.
  * Take responsibility for one's own actions, decisions, and consequences.

I declare that all the work & programs in this repository is entirely my own work.

NOTE: For others, this repo can be a good reference, if someone wants to learn &
understand the aspects of Applied Problem Solving and it's topics
but must not copy the work completed by me or included in this repo!
