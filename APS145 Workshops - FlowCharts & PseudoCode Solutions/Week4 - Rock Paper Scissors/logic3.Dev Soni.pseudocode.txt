      LOGIC 3 GROUP 3 (DEV SONI -130759210)
      
STEP 1 : START (INITIALIZATION) GAME
STEP 2 : OBJECTS DECLARED AS VARIABLES rock, paper, scissors
STEP 3 : INPUT REQUESTED TO THE USER FOR CHOOSING ANY OBJECT

STEP 6 : AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE TIMER, USER REVEALS HIS OBJECT 
STEP 7 : COMPUTER REVEALS HIS OBJECT AS ÔComp_Obj_ChosenÕ THROUGH RANDOM FUNCTION
STEP 8 : IF Comp_Obj_Chosen == paper && Obj_Chosen == rock OR Comp_Obj_Chosen == scissors && Obj_Chosen == paper OR Comp_Obj_Chosen == rock &&  Obj_Chosen == scissors then
	  OUTPUT PRINTS Computer won the match
	  INCREMENT OF THE VARIABLE : Comp_Won++
STEP 9 : ELSE IF Comp_Obj_Chosen == rock && Obj_Chosen == paper OR Comp_Obj_Chosen == scissors && Obj_Chosen == rock OR Comp_Obj_Chosen == paper &&  Obj_Chosen == scissors then
	  OUTPUT PRINTS User won the match
	  INCREMENT OF THE VARIABLE : User_Won++
STEP 10 : ELSE then
	    OUTPUT PRINTS There is a tie ! No one won!!
	    OUTPUT PRINTS There should be a re-match
	    IF THE USER WANTS A RE-MATCH ? then
	    	GOTO STEP 1
	    ELSE then
		WINNER IS DECLARED BASED ON THE POINTS STORED IN THE VARIABLES :
			User_Won AND Comp_Won
		IF User_Won > Comp_Won then
			OUTPUT PRINTS ÒUser Won the match
		ELSE then
			OUTPUT PRINTS Computer won the match
STEP 11 : END (TERMINATION) OF THE GAME
