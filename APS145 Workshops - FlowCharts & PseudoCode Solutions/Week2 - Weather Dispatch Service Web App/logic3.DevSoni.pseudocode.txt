STEP 1 : START 
STEP 2 : Enter the – Type of weather (Snow, Ice, Mixed (combination of both ice and snow) - for LOGIC  3, “Mixed” is entered.
STEP 3 : Enter the accumulation amount per hour:
	a.) If the Type of weather entered is “Mixed”, then accumulation amount per hour will be in centimeters (cm). - (For LOGIC 3)
	b.) If the Type of weather entered is “Snow”, then accumulation amount per hour will be in centimeters (cm).
	c.) Else the accumulation amount per hour will be in millimeters (mm), for Ice weather.
STEP 4 : Enter the Temperature (in Celsius).
STEP 5 : If the accumulation amount per hour is less than or equal to 2.5 cm (<= 2.5 cm)
         Then, no action is required.
STEP 6 : If the accumulation amount per hour is between 2.6 cm and 5.0 cm (2.6 – 5.0 cm),  then:
	a.) If temperature is less than -10.0 (< -10.0), then:
		-1 plow truck and 1 sand truck with light application rate will be needed.
	b.) If temperature is lies between -10.0 and -5.0 (-10.0 to -5.0), then:
		-1 plow truck and 1 salt truck with light application rate will be needed.
	c.) If temperature is more than -5.0 (> -5.0), then:
       		-1 plow truck will be needed, to tackle the situation.
STEP 7: If the accumulation amount per hour is between 5.1 cm and 15.0 cm (5.1 to 15.0 cm),  then:
	a.) If temperature is less than -10.0 (< -10.0), then:
		-1 plow truck and 1 sand truck with heavy application rate will be needed.
	b.) If temperature is lies between -10.0 and -5.0 (-10.0 to -5.0), then:
		-1 plow truck and 1 salt truck with heavy application rate will be needed.
	c.) If temperature is more than -5.0 (> -5.0), then:
		-1 plow truck will be needed and 1 normal (application rate) salt truck will be needed.
STEP 8: If the accumulation amount per hour is between 15.1 cm and 45.0 cm (15.1 to 45.0 cm),  then:
	a.) If temperature is less than -10.0 (< -10.0), then:
		-2 plow trucks and 1 sand truck with heavy application rate will be needed.
	b.) If temperature is lies between -10.0 and -5.0 (-10.0 to -5.0), then:
		-2 plow trucks and 1 salt truck with heavy application rate will be needed.
	c.) If temperature is more than -5.0 (> -5.0), then:
		-2 plow trucks will be needed and 1 light (application rate) salt truck will be needed.
STEP 9: If the accumulation amount per hour is above 45.1 cm (45.1 + cm),  then:
        - State of emergency will be declared (Organized army and other jurisdiction support).
STEP 10: EXIT
